Legacy scripts
==============
The scripts in this directory were created and used by
the Kepler Guest Observer Office during the commissioning of K2,
enabling the scientific cadence data to be inspected quickly.
These scripts were later transformed into the `kadenza` tool
and are now redundant, but are kept here for reference.
